## Usage
```
python 3.6
torch 1.10.2
```

To train from scratch:
```
python main.py
```



## How it works

[main.py](main.py) is our executable. **PPO** policy is here! 

[grid.py](main.py) is our env. **Greedy/Random** policy is here! 

[result] results with different policy and visualize by tensorboard
